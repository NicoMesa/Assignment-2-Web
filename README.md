if you want to.

The project was developed with HTML, CSS and Javascript to give style and order to the front end. The backend 
and connections to the server side is coded in PHP. It includes the ddl statements to create the database and 
tables to be able to store information. Be sure you have the user "root" in the server "localhost" without a password.
